<h3>Testing a service that makes HTTP calls</h3>

<p>
  Testing HTTP services is one area that I find the Angular docs particularly lacking,
  so hopefully this is helpful. In this section, we'll look at how we can test that
  our service makes the correct requests, as well as mocking HTTP responses.
